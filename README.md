This project showcases how to use the Vertical View Stack and Horizontal View Stack, as well as Outlet Collections.

It's a game where a user tries to guess words. The alphabet is listed on the screen and the user selects different letters to guess the word. If the letter is correct, a - at the bottom of the app is replaced with that letter. Otherwise an apple from the tree disappears. If the user guesses incorrectly enough, the game is over.
